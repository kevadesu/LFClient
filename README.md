# LFClient
(A) MultiMC instance(s) designed to make your minecraft experience nicer

This repository is empty because I don't think I can just put the files for LFClient, you'll have to unzip them yourself.

anyways here's the link to the website: https://www.figma.com/proto/9N68C3JRaSTQoHcMZ8WMFO/LFClient?node-id=1-2&scaling=min-zoom&page-id=0%3A1&starting-point-node-id=1%3A2
